Easily control who can comment and when they can comment on any post type.

== Description ==

Ever had someone comment on a post on your site that is really old? With the Advanced Comment Control plugin you can automatically disable commenting on old posts, or only allow certain roles to comment on certain post types. This is one of the easiest ways to handle spam and trolls.

What can you do with the Advanced Comment Control plugin for WordPress?

* Disable comments on select post types older than a certain date.
* Disable comments on select post types with more than a set number of comments.
* Disable pings/trackbacks on select post types older than a certain date.
* Disable pings/trackbacks on select post types with more than a set number of comments.
* Set roles that can always comment on select post types.
* Set roles that can never comment on select post types.
* Set rules for logged in or logged out users.
